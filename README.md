### Objectives:
We aim to create a model that can detect if a person is autistic or not based on facial images.

### Dataset Description:
The ‬‬ ‭‭dataset ‬‬‬consists of 4 folders named train, test, and valid. All the folders are filled with ‬‬‬autism and non-‬‬autism ‭ ‬patient’s ‭ ‬image. ‭ ‬In ‭ ‬this dataset, ‭ ‭the train folder has 1268 ‬‬‬autism-affected images and 1268 non-autism images. In the valid folder, the autism ‬‬‬and non-autism both have 50 images in each sub-folder. Finally, there are 150 files ‬‬‬of images in the test folders. All the images are in jpg format. The total collection of all images is almost 5874. We are going to work on this dataset and implement our model with this dataset using different folders.
